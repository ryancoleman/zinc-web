So the SMILES->ZINC ID search is working using the experimental method
in Toronto. It's much faster than the current method. I'll put both of
these on the WIKI, but felt I should tell you them first so you can
give a more direct reply.

On the Toronto ZINC service we have a way to post a SMILES file (or
single SMILES line) and get back either a list of IDs or a SMILES file
mapped to ZINC IDs. This can be done using either INCHI Keys or INCHI
strings. I haven't done any performance testing, but they shouldn't be
all that different in terms of speed.

Examples:
teague:~$ wget -q --post-file smiles-to-lookup.smi
"http://zinc.uoft.bkslab.org:8080/inchi -O-
ZINC01586379
ZINC00000053
ZINC15202372

teague:~$ wget -q --post-file smiles-to-lookup.smi
"http://zinc.uoft.bkslab.org:8080/inchikey -O-
ZINC01586379
ZINC00000053
ZINC15202372

teague:~$ curl -d 'Cc1ccc(cc1C)c2nnc(o2)NC(=O)c3cccc(c3)[N+](=O)[O-]'
'http://zinc.uoft.bkslab.org:8080/inchi'
ZINC05371990


To use the "old" (official) method would look something like this:
teague:~$curl http://zinc.docking.org/results/structure \
> -F structure.similarity=identity \
> -F structure.upload=@test.smi \
> -F page.format=smiles
COCc1ccccc1 ZINC01586379
CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)[O-] ZINC00000053
CC(=O)NCCC[C@@]1(C(=O)NC(=O)N1)Cc2ccccc2 ZINC15202372
CC(=O)NCCC[C@]1(C(=O)NC(=O)N1)Cc2ccccc2 ZINC15202375

(Note: this is not a 1-to-1 mapping as it is blind to stereo-chemistry)

Hopefully this covers their use cases. Getting PubChem IDs instead of
ZINC IDs is a bit more involved but I'll probably be implementing that
soon as there is growing demand for features like that.
